# Heart Disease Case Study Update Summary

## Completed Tasks ✅

### 1. Updated Heart Cluster Labels
**File**: `/arxiv_submission/sections/generated/heart_labels.tex`

Added meaningful cluster labels derived from Grok's analysis:
- **Layer 1**: High-Risk Older Males vs Lower-Risk Younger Individuals
- **Layer 2**: Low Cardiovascular Stress vs Controlled High-Risk
- **Layer 3**: Stress-Induced Risk vs Moderate-Risk Active
- **Output**: No Heart Disease vs Heart Disease Present

### 2. Created Dedicated Heart Disease Case Study Section
**File**: `/arxiv_submission/sections/heart_disease_case_study.tex`

Comprehensive section including:
- Clinical context and dataset description
- Progressive risk stratification through layers
- Five archetypal patient pathways with statistics
- Clinical decision-making insights
- Bias detection and fairness analysis
- Clinical deployment implications
- Reference to labeled Sankey diagram

### 3. Generated Labeled Heart Disease Sankey Diagram
**Script**: `/experiments/heart_disease/generate_labeled_heart_sankey.py`
**Output Files**:
- Interactive HTML: `/experiments/heart_disease/results/heart_sankey_labeled.html`
- Static PNG: `/experiments/heart_disease/results/heart_sankey_labeled.png`
- Arxiv figure: `/arxiv_submission/figures/heart_membership_overlap_sankey_labeled.png`

The Sankey diagram features:
- Meaningful cluster labels (not just L1C0, L1C1, etc.)
- Color-coded paths showing the 5 archetypes
- Path statistics and distribution
- Highlighted gender bias finding (Path 4: 83.3% male)
- Layer-by-layer progression labels

### 4. Updated Main Document Structure
**File**: `/arxiv_submission/main.tex`

Added heart disease case study section after LLM-Powered Analysis and before GPT-2 studies.

## Key Insights Incorporated

### 1. Five Archetypal Paths
1. **Conservative Low-Risk** (43.3%): Younger → Low CV Stress → No Disease
2. **Classic High-Risk** (35.2%): Older Males → Controlled Risk → Disease
3. **Progressive Risk** (10.7%): Initially low-risk evolving to disease
4. **Male-Biased** (6.7%): 83.3% male, overprediction bias
5. **Misclassification** (2.2%): High-risk features but mostly healthy

### 2. Demographic Biases
- **Gender Bias**: Path 4 shows clear male overprediction
- **Age Bias**: Conservative predictions for younger patients
- **Intersectional Effects**: Struggles with balanced demographics

### 3. Clinical Relevance
- Model mirrors clinical reasoning
- Prioritizes established risk factors
- Fragmentation correlates with diagnostic uncertainty
- Provides built-in confidence measures

## Impact on Paper

The heart disease case study now:
1. Provides concrete proof-of-concept for medical AI interpretability
2. Demonstrates CTA's ability to detect biases
3. Shows clinical applicability with real-world implications
4. Offers visual clarity through labeled Sankey diagram
5. Complements the GPT-2 findings with traditional ML example

The paper now has a strong medical AI component that resonates with healthcare applications and demonstrates CTA's versatility beyond language models.
