# Proofreading Changes Summary

## GPT-2 Technical Accuracy ✅

### Fixed Layer Count Description
- **Before**: "12 transformer layers"
- **After**: "13 layers (embedding layer + 12 transformer blocks)"
- **Files updated**: experimental_design.tex
- **Rationale**: GPT-2 has embedding layer (L0) + 12 transformer blocks (L1-L12)

### Fixed Word Count Inconsistency
- **Before**: Mixed references to 774 and 566 words
- **After**: Consistent 566 words throughout
- **Files updated**: experimental_design.tex, gpt2_semantic_subtypes_case_study.tex
- **Rationale**: 72.8% = 412/566, confirming 566 is correct

### Verified Technical Claims
- ✅ Correctly states we analyze "activation vectors" and "hidden states"
- ✅ 768-dimensional vectors (correct for GPT-2)
- ✅ 117M parameters (correct for GPT-2-small)
- ✅ Layer 0 has k=4, Layers 1-11 have k=2 (consistent)

## Scientific Language Improvements ✅

### Toned Down Hyperbole
1. **Abstract**:
   - "breakthrough" → "novel"
   - "paradigm-shifting" → removed
   - "fundamentally different" → "distinct from"

2. **GPT-2 Semantic Subtypes**:
   - "groundbreaking analysis" → "comprehensive analysis"
   - "massive convergence" → "convergence"

## Remaining Technical Verifications

### Still Accurate:
- Windowed analysis: L0-L3 (Early), L4-L7 (Middle), L8-L11 (Late)
- Stability metrics: 0.724 → 0.339 → 0.341
- Path progression: 19 → 5 → 4
- Convergence: 72.8% (412 words)

### Mathematical Notation:
- Consistent use of $\rho^c$ for centroid similarity
- Consistent use of $J$ for Jaccard/membership overlap  
- Consistent use of $F$ for fragmentation

## Not Changed (Intentionally Kept):
- "Noun superhighway" - vivid metaphor that aids understanding
- "Concept MRI" - effective analogy for the visualization technique
- Clinical terminology in heart disease section

## Next Steps:
1. Final consistency check for terminology
2. Verify all figure/table references
3. Check LaTeX compilation
4. Final readthrough for grammar/typos
