# Final Paper Improvements Summary

## 1. Added Missing GPT-2 Visualizations ✅

### Created Comprehensive Sankey Diagrams:
- **Early Window** (L0-L3): Shows 19 diverse semantic paths
- **Middle Window** (L4-L7): Shows convergence to 5 grammatical paths  
- **Late Window** (L8-L11): Shows 4 stable syntactic superhighways
- **Cluster Legend**: Complete mapping of all cluster labels
- **Archetypal Paths Summary**: Top 5 complete trajectories

### Files Generated:
- `gpt2_sankey_early.png` - Early window visualization
- `gpt2_sankey_middle.png` - Middle window (key convergence)
- `gpt2_sankey_late.png` - Late window 
- `gpt2_cluster_legend.png` - Full cluster label reference
- `gpt2_archetypal_paths_summary.md` - Detailed path analysis
- `gpt2_combined_sankey_caption.tex` - LaTeX figure inclusion

### Added to Paper:
- Inserted comprehensive figure in GPT-2 semantic subtypes section
- Figure shows all three windows with cluster labels
- Caption explains the semantic-to-grammatical transformation

## 2. Removed Titanic Content ✅

### Removed from llm_powered_analysis.tex:
- Deleted `\input{sections/generated/titanic_labels}`
- Deleted `\input{sections/generated/titanic_report}`
- Removed Titanic fragmentation metrics table
- Updated text to reference only Heart Disease dataset

### Result:
- Paper now focuses on two strong case studies: Heart Disease + GPT-2
- No scattered Titanic references remaining

## 3. Fixed Technical Accuracy ✅

### GPT-2 Architecture:
- Corrected: "13 layers (embedding layer + 12 transformer blocks)"
- Fixed word count: Consistent 566 words (was mixed 774/566)
- Clarified: Analyzing hidden states/activation vectors

### Scientific Language:
- "breakthrough" → "novel"
- "groundbreaking" → "comprehensive"
- Removed hyperbolic language while keeping impact

## 4. Improved Coherence ✅

### Structural Improvements:
- Added GPT-2 Sankey visualization where referenced
- Removed redundant Titanic content
- Standardized terminology (L{layer}_C{cluster})

### Missing Elements Added:
- GPT-2 "Concept MRI" visualization (was mentioned but missing)
- Heart disease Sankey with meaningful labels
- Archetypal paths documentation

## 5. Key Visualizations Now in Paper

### Heart Disease:
- Labeled Sankey diagram showing 5 patient archetypes
- Cluster labels reveal risk stratification strategy
- Bias findings highlighted (83.3% male in Path 4)

### GPT-2:
- Three-window Sankey showing 19→5→4 convergence
- Cluster legend with all semantic labels
- Clear visualization of grammar-over-semantics finding

## Impact on Paper Quality

The paper now has:
1. **Complete visualizations** for both major case studies
2. **Focused narrative** without scattered Titanic references
3. **Technical accuracy** regarding GPT-2 architecture
4. **Professional tone** appropriate for academic publication
5. **Visual evidence** supporting the key finding that GPT-2 organizes by grammar not semantics

## Recommendations Successfully Implemented

From the coherence analysis:
- ✅ Removed Titanic content
- ✅ Added missing GPT-2 Sankey diagrams  
- ✅ Standardized terminology
- ✅ Fixed repetitive content
- ✅ Added all three windows + legend as requested

The paper is now more coherent, complete, and ready for final submission.
