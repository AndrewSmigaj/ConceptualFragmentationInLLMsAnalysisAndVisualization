    \caption{Concept MRI Middle Window (L4-L7): Grammatical Convergence. The phase transition becomes evident as semantic clusters reorganize into grammatical categories, with 50.1\% of words converging to primary pathways. Path count reduces from 26 to 8 as grammatical organization emerges.}

    \caption{Concept MRI Late Window (L8-L11): Syntactic Superhighways. Final layers show consolidated grammatical organization with only 5 paths remaining. The visualization demonstrates that transformers develop grammatical organization as their primary macro-structure while maintaining semantic distinctions within these pathways, validated by highly significant grammatical clustering ($\chi^2 = 95.90$, $p < 0.0001$).}
