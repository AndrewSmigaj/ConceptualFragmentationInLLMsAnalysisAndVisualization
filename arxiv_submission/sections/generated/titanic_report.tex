\section*{Holistic System Analysis Report: Titanic Dataset}
(Details for top 7 archetypes were included in the prompt)

\subsection*{1. Holistic Interpretation}
- This 3-layer feedforward neural network seems to process data in stages of abstraction and convergence. The model starts with a larger set of input data and gradually refines and distills it down to a final decision.
- The high FC score (see Section 3.6) of 1.000 suggests that the model is highly specialized with each path being very distinct and separate from others. This could imply that the model is processing data based on very specific criteria or patterns.
- The CE value (see Section 3.6) of 0.862 ± 0.018 suggests that the model is making decisions with a moderate amount of uncertainty. This could indicate that the model is using a balance of exploration and exploitation to make decisions.
- The SA value (see Section 3.6) of 6.5° ± 3.6° shows that the model's decision boundaries are quite spread out in the input space, suggesting that the model is capturing a variety of different patterns in the data.
- The Optimal Cluster Count k* of 4.5 suggests that the model has a preference for smaller clusters, indicating that it is splitting the data into more specific and narrow categories.

\subsection*{2. Comparative Path Analysis}
- Archetypal paths 1, 2, and 3 all end in the same cluster (L1C0$\rightarrow$L2C1$\rightarrow$L3C0), but start from different clusters. This suggests that these paths represent different types of passengers who all ended up in the same final state.
- Archetype 4 differs from the others in that it takes a different path from the second layer onwards (L1C1$\rightarrow$L2C0$\rightarrow$L3C1). This implies that this path is associated with a different type of decision-making process, possibly related to different passenger characteristics.
- Archetype 5 is similar to archetypes 1, 2, and 3 but starts from a different cluster, suggesting that it represents a different type of passenger who also ends up in the same final state.

\subsection*{3. Key Decision-Making Insights}
- The fact that several paths converge to the same final cluster (L3C0) suggests that the model is making decisions based on a common set of criteria or factors.
- The variation in the initial clusters suggests that the model is taking different types of input data (e.g., age, sex, passenger class, fare) into account when making decisions.

\subsection*{4. System-Wide Fairness \& Bias Assessment}
- The fact that the majority of passengers in all paths are male could indicate a potential gender bias in the model's decision-making process.
- The variation in passenger class across the different paths suggests that the model is treating passengers from different classes differently. This could potentially lead to unfair outcomes for passengers in lower classes.

\subsection*{5. Synthesis and Story}
- The 3-layer feedforward neural network model processes Titanic dataset in a highly specialized way, focusing on specific patterns in the data to make decisions. The model takes a variety of factors into account, including age, sex, passenger class, and fare.
- Archetype 1 represents older male passengers in lower classes who paid lower fares. They generally did not survive.
- Archetype 2 represents slightly younger male passengers in higher classes who paid higher fares. They had a slightly higher survival rate.
- Archetype 3 represents younger male passengers in a mix of classes who paid moderate fares. They generally did not survive.
- Archetype 4 represents a balanced mix of male and female passengers from a range of ages and classes who paid higher fares. They had a moderate survival rate.
- Archetype 5 represents younger male passengers in a mix of classes who paid lower fares. They had a moderate survival rate.
- Overall, the model seems to favor passengers who are younger, male, in higher classes, and who paid higher fares. This suggests potential biases in the model's decision-making process.
