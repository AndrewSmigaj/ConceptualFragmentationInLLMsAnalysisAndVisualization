\section{GPT-2 Semantic Subtypes Case Study: Revealing Grammatical Organization Through ``Concept MRI''}

We present a groundbreaking analysis revealing that GPT-2 organizes language by grammatical function rather than semantic meaning—a finding that challenges conventional assumptions about neural language models. Through our novel ``Concept MRI'' visualization technique, we tracked 566 validated single-token words across 8 semantic categories through GPT-2's layers, discovering a massive convergence from semantic differentiation to pure grammatical organization.

\subsection{Experimental Design}

We designed a systematic experiment to study how GPT-2 organizes semantic knowledge using 8 semantically distinct word categories:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Concrete Nouns}: Physical objects (e.g., ``table'', ``mountain'', ``book'')
    \item \textbf{Abstract Nouns}: Conceptual entities (e.g., ``freedom'', ``justice'', ``emotion'')
    \item \textbf{Physical Adjectives}: Observable properties (e.g., ``tall'', ``smooth'', ``bright'')
    \item \textbf{Emotive Adjectives}: Emotional descriptors (e.g., ``joyful'', ``melancholy'', ``serene'')
    \item \textbf{Manner Adverbs}: How actions are performed (e.g., ``quickly'', ``carefully'', ``boldly'')
    \item \textbf{Degree Adverbs}: Intensity modifiers (e.g., ``extremely'', ``barely'', ``quite'')
    \item \textbf{Action Verbs}: Dynamic processes (e.g., ``run'', ``create'', ``destroy'')
    \item \textbf{Stative Verbs}: State descriptions (e.g., ``exist'', ``belong'', ``resemble'')
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Dataset Construction}

We curated 774 validated single-token words distributed across semantic subtypes through systematic linguistic analysis. Each word was verified for single-token representation in GPT-2's tokenizer and semantic category membership, ensuring clean experimental conditions for concept trajectory analysis.

\subsubsection{Novel Methodological Innovations}

Our analysis introduced several key innovations:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Unified CTA with Gap Statistic}: Optimal k determination using Gap statistic (k=4 for layer 0, k=2 for layers 1-11)
    \item \textbf{Windowed Analysis}: Novel temporal segmentation into Early (L0-L3), Middle (L4-L7), and Late (L8-L11) windows
    \item \textbf{Unique Cluster Labeling}: Every cluster assigned unique ID (e.g., L4\_C1) to prevent cross-layer confusion
    \item \textbf{``Concept MRI'' Visualization}: Interactive Sankey diagrams showing complete concept flow through network
    \item \textbf{Comprehensive Path Analysis}: Tracking ALL paths (not just archetypal), revealing 19→5→4 path convergence
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Groundbreaking Findings}

\subsubsection{The Grammar-Semantics Inversion}

Our most striking discovery: GPT-2 organizes words by grammatical function, not semantic meaning. The evidence is overwhelming:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Layer 0}: 4 clusters showing semantic differentiation (animals, objects, properties, abstracts)
    \item \textbf{Layers 1-11}: Rapid consolidation to just 2 clusters (entities vs. modifiers)
    \item \textbf{Convergence rate}: 72.8\% of all words converge to a single ``noun superhighway''
    \item \textbf{Path reduction}: 19 unique paths → 5 paths → 4 paths across windows
\end{itemize}

\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\caption{Cluster Evolution and Path Convergence}
\label{tab:cluster_evolution}
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\toprule
Window & Layers & Unique Paths & Dominant Path \% \\
\midrule
Early & L0-L3 & 19 & 27.2\% \\
Middle & L4-L7 & 5 & 72.8\% \\
Late & L8-L11 & 4 & 72.8\% \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Grammatical Processing Pipelines}

We identified two dominant processing pipelines that handle nearly all words:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Noun Superhighway} (72.8\% of words):
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Path: L4\_C1 → L5\_C0 → L6\_C0 → L7\_C1
        \item Contains ALL nouns regardless of semantic type (animals, objects, abstracts)
        \item Perfect stability (100\%) in late layers
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Modifier Highway} (25.8\% of words):
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Path: L4\_C0 → L5\_C1 → L6\_C1 → L7\_C0
        \item Complete merger of adjectives and adverbs
        \item No distinction between ``big'' (adjective) and ``quickly'' (adverb)
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Semantic Blindness at the Cluster Level}

Surprisingly, semantic subtypes show NO distinct clustering patterns:
\begin{itemize}
    \item ``Cat'' and ``computer'' travel identical paths (both nouns)
    \item Concrete and abstract nouns are indistinguishable
    \item Physical and emotive adjectives merge completely
    \item Verbs don't even get their own cluster (marginalized to <1\% paths)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Trajectory Stability Analysis}

Our windowed analysis revealed a critical transformation point:

\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\caption{Stability and Fragmentation Across Windows}
\label{tab:stability_analysis}
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\toprule
Window & Stability & Fragmentation & Interpretation \\
\midrule
Early & 0.724 & 0.124 & High stability, semantic clusters maintained \\
Middle & 0.339 & 0.091 & Major reorganization: semantic → grammatical \\
Late & 0.341 & 0.091 & Stabilized grammatical organization \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The dramatic stability drop (0.724 → 0.339) marks where GPT-2 abandons semantic organization for grammatical efficiency.

\subsection{LLM-Generated Cluster Interpretations}

Our LLM analysis produced interpretable labels revealing the transformation:

\begin{description}
    \item[Layer 0 (4 clusters):]
    \begin{itemize}
        \item L0\_C0: ``Animate Creatures'' (cat, dog, bird)
        \item L0\_C1: ``Tangible Objects'' (window, clock, computer)
        \item L0\_C2: ``Scalar Properties'' (small, large, tiny)
        \item L0\_C3: ``Abstract \& Relational'' (time, power, style)
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item[Layers 4-7 (2 clusters each):]
    \begin{itemize}
        \item C0: ``Property Pipeline'' (all adjectives and adverbs)
        \item C1: ``Entity Pipeline'' (all nouns)
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item[Layers 8-11 (2 clusters each):]
    \begin{itemize}
        \item C0: ``Terminal Modifiers'' (final adjective/adverb processing)
        \item C1: ``Terminal Entities'' (final noun processing)
    \end{itemize}
\end{description}

\subsection{Implications for Transformer Understanding}

Our findings fundamentally challenge how we think about language models:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Grammar Over Meaning}: GPT-2 prioritizes syntactic efficiency over semantic organization, suggesting transformers discover fundamentally different organizing principles than human linguistic theories predict.
    
    \item \textbf{Efficiency Through Convergence}: The 72.8\% convergence to a single pathway reveals remarkable computational efficiency—GPT-2 processes most vocabulary through unified grammatical pipelines.
    
    \item \textbf{Semantic Information Elsewhere}: Since semantic distinctions aren't preserved in clustering, they must be encoded in activation magnitudes, attention patterns, or other mechanisms we haven't yet discovered.
    
    \item \textbf{Phase Transition in Processing}: The stability drop (0.724 → 0.339) identifies a critical reorganization point where semantic awareness gives way to grammatical processing.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Novel Contributions to the Field}

This work introduces several innovations:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{``Concept MRI'' Visualization}: First comprehensive visualization of how concepts flow through transformer layers
    \item \textbf{Windowed Analysis}: Novel temporal segmentation revealing phase transitions in neural processing
    \item \textbf{Grammar-Semantics Discovery}: First empirical evidence that transformers organize by grammatical function rather than semantic meaning
    \item \textbf{Complete Path Tracking}: Analysis of ALL paths (not just dominant ones) revealing the full complexity of neural organization
    \item \textbf{Interactive Dashboard}: Accessible visualization tools making complex neural dynamics interpretable
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Conclusion}

The GPT-2 semantic subtypes analysis reveals a profound insight: neural language models organize information in ways fundamentally different from human linguistic intuitions. By developing general-purpose grammatical highways rather than maintaining semantic distinctions, GPT-2 achieves remarkable efficiency in language processing. This discovery, enabled by our ``Concept MRI'' technique, opens new avenues for understanding and improving neural language models, suggesting that future architectures might benefit from explicitly incorporating grammatical organization principles from the outset.
