# Academic Tone Revision Plan

## Overall Issues to Address

1. **Remove marketing language**
   - "Concept MRI" → "trajectory visualization"
   - "entity superhighway" → "dominant pathway" or "primary trajectory"
   - "striking discovery" → "key finding"
   - "compelling evidence" → "statistical evidence"

2. **Tone down claims**
   - "reveals that" → "suggests that" or "provides evidence that"
   - "demonstrates" → "indicates" (unless statistically proven)
   - Remove superlatives ("most striking", "dramatic transformation")

3. **Improve precision**
   - Add confidence intervals where appropriate
   - Qualify statements with "in our analysis" or "our results indicate"
   - Replace informal questions with formal statements

4. **Reduce redundancy**
   - Consolidate overlapping contributions
   - Remove repetitive explanations
   - Streamline bullet point lists

## Section-by-Section Revisions

### 1. Abstract ✓
- Already revised to be more formal and precise
- Good balance of technical detail and accessibility

### 2. Introduction
**Issues:**
- Informal opening ("Consider this question")
- Too many contributions (11 bullet points)
- Marketing terms ("Concept MRI")
- Overstated claims about what CTA "reveals"

**Revisions needed:**
- Replace opening with formal problem statement
- Reduce contributions to 5-6 key points
- Replace "Concept MRI" with "trajectory visualization"
- Qualify claims appropriately

### 3. Background
**Issues:**
- Generally appropriate but could be more concise
- Some notation inconsistencies

**Revisions needed:**
- Ensure consistent notation throughout
- Tighten prose

### 4. Mathematical Foundation
**Issues:**
- Mix of informal and formal language
- "entity superhighway" terminology
- Some sections too verbose

**Revisions needed:**
- Standardize terminology
- Remove informal examples
- Focus on mathematical rigor

### 5. Experimental Design
**Issues:**
- Generally appropriate
- Minor terminology issues

**Revisions needed:**
- Ensure consistency with revised terminology

### 6. GPT-2 Case Study
**Issues:**
- "Grammar-Semantics Inversion" - too sensational
- "Concept MRI" branding
- Overstated claims ("striking discovery")
- Informal language throughout

**Revisions needed:**
- Replace sensational headings with descriptive ones
- Remove marketing terminology
- Qualify findings appropriately
- Use formal academic language

### 7. Heart Disease Case Study
**Issues:**
- Generally more appropriate than GPT-2 section
- Some informal phrasing

**Revisions needed:**
- Minor adjustments for consistency
- Ensure medical terminology is precise

### 8. LLM-Powered Analysis
**Issues:**
- Need to check for informal language
- Ensure technical accuracy

**Revisions needed:**
- Review and adjust tone as needed

### 9. Conclusion
**Issues:**
- Repetitive (restates findings multiple times)
- Mix of strong and weak claims
- Good limitations section but could be more concise

**Revisions needed:**
- Reduce repetition
- Consistent claim strength
- Tighten limitations section

### 10. Future Directions
**Issues:**
- Some speculative language
- Mix of near-term and far-term ideas

**Revisions needed:**
- Focus on concrete, achievable directions
- Remove overly speculative claims

## Key Terminology Changes
- "Concept MRI" → "trajectory visualization tool"
- "entity superhighway" → "dominant noun pathway" or "primary entity trajectory"
- "Grammar-Semantics Inversion" → "Grammatical Organization in Neural Language Models"
- "striking/compelling" → "notable/significant"
- "reveals" → "indicates/suggests" (unless statistically proven)

## Writing Style Guidelines
1. Use passive voice where appropriate for objectivity
2. Avoid rhetorical questions
3. Present findings as observations, not discoveries
4. Include confidence intervals and effect sizes
5. Qualify interpretations appropriately
6. Maintain consistent technical terminology
7. Avoid marketing or product-like language
