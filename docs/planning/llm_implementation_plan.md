# LLM Integration Implementation Plan

## Completed Tasks

1. **Core LLM Integration Framework**
   - ✅ Created base client class (`client.py`)
   - ✅ Implemented standardized response format (`responses.py`)
   - ✅ Built client factory pattern (`factory.py`)
   - ✅ Added provider-specific implementations
     - ✅ OpenAI/Grok client (`openai_client.py`)
     - ✅ Claude client (`claude.py`)
     - ✅ Grok native client (`grok.py`)
     - ✅ Gemini client (`gemini.py`)
   - ✅ Implemented high-level analysis API (`analysis.py`)
   - ✅ Created demo script (`demo.py`)

2. **Dashboard Integration**
   - ✅ Added LLM tab to dashboard (`llm_tab.py`)
   - ✅ Implemented cluster labeling UI
   - ✅ Implemented path narrative UI
   - ✅ Added provider selection

3. **Data Integration**
   - ✅ Fixed cluster paths data to include centroids
   - ✅ Made LLM demo script compatible with multiple file formats
   - ✅ Added verification step for centroid data
   - ✅ Enhanced script runner for easy execution

4. **Documentation**
   - ✅ Added README for LLM module
   - ✅ Created testing documentation
   - ✅ Added setup summary

## Next Tasks (For Tomorrow)

1. **Testing & Refinement**
   - [ ] Test with real LLM providers
   - [ ] Analyze response quality
   - [ ] Refine prompts as needed:
      - [ ] Improve cluster labeling prompts
      - [ ] Enhance path narrative prompts
      - [ ] Add context about dataset specifics

2. **Feature Expansion**
   - [ ] Add comparative analysis between paths
   - [ ] Implement concept drift detection 
   - [ ] Add automatic report generation
   - [ ] Support more datasets beyond Titanic

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - [ ] Enhance caching mechanism
   - [ ] Add concurrent processing for batch requests
   - [ ] Optimize token usage in prompts

4. **Integration Enhancements**
   - [ ] Add support for user-defined prompts
   - [ ] Implement feedback mechanism for LLM outputs
   - [ ] Create export functionality for analysis results

## Technical Notes

### Cluster Paths Data Format
The LLM integration depends on cluster paths data that includes:
- `id_mapping`: Maps unique cluster IDs to layer/cluster information 
- `unique_centroids`: Maps unique cluster IDs to their centroid vectors
- `path_archetypes`: Contains summarized path information for common paths

All required fields are now properly included in the output of `cluster_paths.py`.

### API Keys Configuration
API keys should be configured in `concept_fragmentation/llm/api_keys.py`:
```python
OPENAI_KEY = "your-key"        # For OpenAI/GPT or Grok (OpenAI-compatible)
OPENAI_API_BASE = "url"        # Base URL for OpenAI-compatible APIs
XAI_API_KEY = "your-key"       # For Grok/xAI native API
GEMINI_API_KEY = "your-key"    # For Google Gemini
```

### Preferred Providers
Based on our testing:
1. Grok (via OpenAI-compatible API) offers good results with minimal setup
2. Gemini provides competitive quality and good response speed
3. Forthcoming tests with other providers will expand this comparison
