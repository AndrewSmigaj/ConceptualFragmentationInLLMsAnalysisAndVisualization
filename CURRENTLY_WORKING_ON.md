# Currently Working On - Concept MRI Development

## üéØ Current Focus: Building Concept MRI Tool

### Overview
We are developing **Concept MRI**, a web-based tool for analyzing and auditing neural networks to understand how they organize concepts internally. This tool **does NOT train models** - it only analyzes pre-trained models.

### Key Context
- **Main Tool Location**: `/concept_mri/`
- **Training Scripts** (separate): `/scripts/prepare_demo_models/`
- **Purpose**: Visualize concept fragmentation in neural networks
- **Status**: Core infrastructure complete, need to train demo models

## üìã Current Task Status

### ‚úÖ Completed Infrastructure
1. **Concept MRI App Structure**
   - Dash-based web application (`concept_mri/app.py`)
   - Feedforward Networks tab (`concept_mri/tabs/ff_networks.py`)
   - Model upload/dataset upload components
   - Clustering configuration panel
   - Sankey diagram visualization wrapper

2. **Component Verification** (Session: May 31, 2025)
   - Fixed all import issues
   - Installed missing dependencies
   - All components now load and instantiate correctly
   - Ready for enhancement

3. **Demo Model Training Infrastructure** (separate from Concept MRI)
   - `ModelTrainer` class - reuses existing data loaders
   - `OptimizableFFNet` - flexible architecture (any number of layers)
   - Multiple variants configured
   - CLI script: `train_demo_models.py`

### ‚úÖ Completed: LLM Analysis Integration

**What Was Done**:
- ‚úÖ Integrated comprehensive LLM analysis API with Concept MRI UI
- ‚úÖ Added "LLM Analysis" tab to results section in `ff_networks.py`
- ‚úÖ Added analysis category selection (Interpretation, Bias, Efficiency, Robustness)
- ‚úÖ Created comprehensive usage documentation in `docs/comprehensive_llm_analysis_usage.md`
- ‚úÖ Created API reference documentation in `docs/llm_analysis_api_reference.md`
- ‚úÖ Created simple demo model in `concept_mri/demos/synthetic_demo/`
- ‚úÖ Verified clustering data format compatibility

**Key Implementation Details**:
- No adapters or transformers - direct API integration
- Reused existing `cluster_paths.py` functionality
- ~150 lines of code for complete UI integration
- Bias detection integrated as analysis category (no separate component needed)

### ‚úÖ Testing Complete: Full Pipeline Working!

**What Was Tested** (Session: June 1, 2025):
- ‚úÖ Concept MRI app starts successfully with proper imports
- ‚úÖ Full pipeline test script (`test_full_pipeline.py`) runs end-to-end
- ‚úÖ Clustering ‚Üí path extraction ‚Üí LLM analysis flow works correctly
- ‚úÖ LLM analysis returns meaningful interpretations
- ‚úÖ Created comprehensive documentation:
  - `RUNNING_THE_APP.md` - How to run and test the app
  - `LLM_INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md` - Integration details
  - `TESTING_CHECKLIST.md` - Manual testing guide

**Pipeline Test Results**:
- Demo model loads correctly (3 hidden layers: [32, 16, 8])
- Clustering produces expected paths (20 unique paths from 100 samples)
- LLM analysis generates interpretations successfully
- Fixed encoding issues and import errors

### ‚úÖ Completed: Session Storage for Activations (Session: June 1, 2025 - 9:30 PM PT)

**Problem Solved**:
- Dash stores serialize data to JSON, converting numpy arrays to lists
- This caused "Could not compute stability metrics: 'list' object has no attribute 'shape'" error
- Solution: Store activations in session-based ActivationManager outside of Dash stores

**Implementation**:
1. **Extended ActivationManager** (`concept_mri/core/activation_manager.py`)
   - Added session storage methods to existing class
   - Memory management with 2GB limit and 2-hour timeout
   - Thread-safe operations for multi-user support

2. **Updated Activation Extraction Callback**
   - Stores activations in ActivationManager with session ID
   - Only stores session ID reference in model-store
   - Uses session ID from session-id-store

3. **Updated All Consumers**
   - Window callbacks retrieve from session storage
   - Clustering panel uses helper function
   - Maintains backward compatibility with direct storage

4. **Documentation & Cleanup**
   - Updated ARCHITECTURE.md with storage design
   - Removed all debug print statements
   - Archived old crash recovery note

### üéØ Remaining Tasks

**High Priority**:
1. **UI Testing** - Manually verify the web interface displays results correctly
   - Test model/dataset upload
   - Verify clustering works without errors
   - Check window detection metrics
   - Test LLM analysis flow

2. **Fix any UI bugs** found during manual testing

**Medium Priority**:
3. **Create Video Demo**
   - Record workflow: upload model ‚Üí cluster ‚Üí analyze ‚Üí view results
   - Show bias detection capabilities
   - Demonstrate different analysis categories

**Low Priority**:
4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Add progress indicators for long-running operations
   - Implement streaming for large analysis results
   - Add result caching in UI

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Notes

### Separation of Concerns
- **Concept MRI** (`/concept_mri/`): Analysis and visualization only
- **Training Scripts** (`/scripts/prepare_demo_models/`): Model creation only
- **Existing Infrastructure** (`/concept_fragmentation/`): Core library

### Key Design Decisions
1. Reuse all existing data loaders from `concept_fragmentation`
2. Models saved with architecture info for easy loading
3. Multiple variants to demonstrate different behaviors
4. Clean separation between training and analysis
5. Session-based activation storage to handle numpy arrays properly

### Model Save Format
```python
{
    'model_state_dict': state_dict,
    'input_size': int,
    'output_size': int,
    'architecture': [hidden_sizes],
    'activation': str,
    'dropout_rate': float
}
```

### Activation Storage Architecture
```python
# Storing activations (in callbacks)
session_id = activation_manager.store_activations(
    session_id=session_id,  # From session-id-store
    activations=processed_activations,
    metadata={...}
)
model_data['activation_session_id'] = session_id

# Retrieving activations (in analysis)
activations = activation_manager.get_activations(session_id)
if activations is None:
    # Fall back to direct storage
    activations = model_data.get('activations', {})
```

## üí° Suggestions for Better Continuity

### 1. **Session Start Protocol**
When starting a new session, you could say:
```
"Continue working on Concept MRI - check CURRENTLY_WORKING_ON.md"
```

### 2. **Key Information to Include**
- Current task from TODO list
- Any blocking issues
- Specific files you were working on
- Any decisions that need to be made

### 3. **Session End Protocol**
Before ending, I can update this file with:
- Last completed task
- Next immediate task
- Any important context or decisions made

### 4. **Alternative Approaches**
- **Branch-based context**: Create a branch for each work session
- **Issue tracking**: Use GitHub issues for task management
- **Session logs**: Keep a `SESSION_LOGS/` directory with dated entries

### 5. **Quick Commands**
You could use shorthand commands like:
- "Continue Concept MRI" - I'll read this file and continue
- "Update context" - I'll update this file with current state
- "Show progress" - I'll summarize what's been done
