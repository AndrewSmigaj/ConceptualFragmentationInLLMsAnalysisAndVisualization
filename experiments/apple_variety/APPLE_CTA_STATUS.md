# Apple CTA Experiment Status

## Current Status
We have successfully implemented CTA (Concept Trajectory Analysis) for apple quality routing prediction. The system is working but has one remaining issue with output layer cluster labels not showing routing distributions in the Sankey diagram.

## Key Accomplishment: Understanding CTA's Core Innovation
**The critical innovation of CTA is LLM-powered interpretation of clusters and trajectories.** This was the missing piece that makes the entire system work. Without LLM analysis, we just have unlabeled clusters and paths. With it, we get semantic understanding of what each cluster represents and how samples flow through the network.

## What's Working
1. **Quality Routing Prediction**: Successfully predicting fresh_premium, fresh_standard, or juice routing (NOT variety classification)
2. **LLM Integration**: Using Grok-3 for cluster interpretation and path analysis
3. **Cluster Profiling**: Generating interpretable descriptions using original feature values (Brix, firmness, size, etc.)
4. **Sankey Visualization**: Creating full network view with semantic labels
5. **Economic Analysis**: Tracking $2/lb losses when premium varieties get misrouted to juice

## Current Technical Issue
The output layer (L3) clusters should show routing distributions (e.g., "Premium Apples â†’ fresh_premium 85%, fresh_standard 15%") but this isn't working because:
- The `_get_output_cluster_routing()` method can't access the cluster assignments
- The code incorrectly maintains train/test split for clustering (against CTA principles)
- CTA should analyze ALL data together, not separate train/test

## Critical Misunderstanding to Fix
**CTA is NOT about train/test evaluation!** It's about understanding how the neural network processes ALL data:
1. Train the NN on training data (for the supervised task)
2. Collect activations from ALL data (train + test combined)
3. Cluster these combined activations
4. Analyze trajectories through unified clusters

The current code incorrectly keeps train/test separate during clustering, which violates CTA's purpose.

## Key Code Sections

### Layer Naming (CTA Standard)
```python
# Use CTA standard naming: L0, L1, L2, L3 instead of PyTorch names
layer_names = ['L0', 'L1', 'L2', 'L3']
```

### Output Cluster Routing (needs fixing)
```python
def _get_output_cluster_routing(self, cluster_key: str) -> Optional[str]:
    """Get routing distribution for an output layer cluster."""
    # This method needs access to cluster assignments which aren't stored properly
    # Should show: "fresh_premium 75%, fresh_standard 25%"
```

### Sankey Title
Changed from "K=10 Token Flow" to "Apple Quality Routing" with "samples" instead of "tokens"

## Economic Story
- Premium varieties (Honeycrisp, Fuji) getting routed to juice = $2/lb loss
- Fragmentation in routing indicates quality assessment uncertainty
- Goal: Identify which varieties consistently get misrouted

## Next Steps
1. **Fix CTA Implementation**: Combine all data for clustering (no train/test split)
2. **Fix Output Labels**: Make routing distributions appear on L3 clusters
3. **Increase Varieties**: Change `n_varieties` from 5 to 15-20 in config
4. **Run Full Experiment**: Generate complete results with all varieties
5. **Create Paper Figures**: Not placeholder images but real analysis results
6. **Write Paper**: Focus on economic impact and LLM-discovered patterns

## Important Context
- User wants "no broken windows" approach - fix things properly, not quick hacks
- CTA paper established L0/L1/L2/L3 naming convention - use it consistently
- Single Sankey diagram for full network (not windowed views like GPT-2)
- Font size 12, top 25 paths, inline labels for output layer
- Grok-3 is working well as LLM provider (OpenAI hit quota limits)

## File Locations
- Main experiment: `/experiments/apple_variety/run_experiment.py`
- Prompts: `/experiments/apple_variety/apple_prompts.py`
- Config: `/experiments/apple_variety/config_test.yaml`
- Results: `/experiments/apple_variety/results/apple_variety_test/`
- Sankey generator: `/concept_fragmentation/visualization/sankey.py`

## Session Summary
This has been a long session establishing:
1. The core purpose (quality routing, not variety classification)
2. The key innovation (LLM-powered interpretation)
3. The proper implementation (following CTA paper standards)
4. The business value (economic impact of misrouting)

The system is 90% complete - just needs the clustering approach fixed and output labels working.
