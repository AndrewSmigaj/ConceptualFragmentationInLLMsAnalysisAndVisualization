# Crash Recovery Note - May 31, 2025

## Current State

### Just Completed
- Full implementation of Concept MRI demo model training infrastructure
- All code is written and committed
- Ready to actually train models

### Working On
- Planning next experiment: Dual Embedding for contextual influence on ambiguous tokens
- Wrote comprehensive proposal in previous message (not saved to file)

### Next Immediate Steps
1. Train demo models for Concept MRI:
   ```bash
   cd scripts/prepare_demo_models
   python train_demo_models.py --dataset titanic --variant optimal
   ```

2. Save the dual embedding experiment proposal to a file

3. Add demo model dropdown to FF networks tab

### Key Files Modified Today
- `/concept_mri/` - New web app for neural network analysis
- `/scripts/prepare_demo_models/` - Training infrastructure
- `/concept_mri/core/model_interface.py` - Enhanced to load demo models
- `CURRENTLY_WORKING_ON.md` - Main context document

### Repository State
- 3 commits ahead of origin/main
- All changes committed
- Ready to push when appropriate

### Context
Building Concept MRI, a tool to analyze (not train) neural networks and visualize concept fragmentation. The training scripts are separate and used only to create demo models.
