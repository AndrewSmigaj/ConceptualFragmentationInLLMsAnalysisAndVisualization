EXPERIMENTAL SUITABILITY:
Overall assessment: EXCELLENT - Sufficient words for robust analysis
Balance quality: EXCELLENT - Well-balanced across subtypes

RECOMMENDATIONS:
* Dataset is ready for GPT-2 semantic analysis
* Sufficient words for clustering and path analysis
* Good semantic diversity across all major POS categories
* 5 subtypes have full 100-word sets

NEXT STEPS:
1. Proceed with GPT-2 activation extraction
2. Apply clustering analysis (k-means + HDBSCAN)
3. Calculate APA metrics and path coherence
4. Generate semantic subtype interpretation
