# Repository Reorganization Summary

## Completed Actions

### ✅ Phase 1: Directory Structure Created
- Created `experiments/` hierarchy for all experiment code
- Created `scripts/` hierarchy for utility scripts
- Created `sample_data/` for example files

### ✅ Phase 2: Files Moved Successfully

#### GPT-2 Experiments
- **Semantic Subtypes**: All files moved to `experiments/gpt2/semantic_subtypes/`
  - Python scripts: `gpt2_semantic_subtypes_*.py`
  - Data files: `gpt2_semantic_subtypes_*.json` and `*.txt`
- **Pivot Experiment**: Files moved to `experiments/gpt2/pivot/`
  - Python scripts: `gpt2_pivot_*.py`
  - Data files: `gpt2_pivot_*.json` and `*.txt`
- **POS Experiment**: Files moved to `experiments/gpt2/pos/`
  - Python script: `gpt2_pos_experiment.py`
  - Data files: `gpt2_pos_*.json` and `*.txt`
- **Shared Utilities**: Moved to `experiments/gpt2/shared/`
  - `gpt2_activation_extractor.py`
  - `gpt2_apa_metrics.py`
  - `gpt2_clustering_comparison.py`
  - `gpt2_token_validator.py`

#### Other Experiments
- **Heart Disease**: Files moved to `experiments/heart_disease/`
- **Titanic**: Data moved to `experiments/titanic/data/`

#### Scripts
- **Analysis Scripts**: Moved to `scripts/analysis/`
- **Visualization Scripts**: Moved to `scripts/visualization/`
- **Utilities**: Moved to `scripts/utilities/`
- **Maintenance**: PowerShell scripts moved to `scripts/maintenance/`

#### Sample Data
- Example files moved to `sample_data/`

### ✅ Phase 3: Import Updates
- Updated imports in `gpt2_semantic_subtypes_experiment.py` to work from new location
- Created `experiments/__init__.py` for backward compatibility

## What Remains in Root
- `config.py` - Main configuration (intentionally kept)
- `run_gpt2_analysis.py` - Main GPT-2 runner
- `run_integration_tests.py` - Integration test runner
- Test files (`test_*.py`) - Temporarily kept in root
- Documentation files (README.md, paper.md, etc.)
- `run_dashboard.bat` and `run_dashboard_with_paths.bat` - Dashboard launchers

## Verification Checklist
- ✅ Directory structure created successfully
- ✅ Files copied and originals removed
- ✅ Import paths updated for semantic subtypes experiment
- ✅ Dashboard launcher still points to correct location
- ✅ ArXiv paper unaffected (no code dependencies)
- ✅ README files created for new directories

## Benefits Achieved
1. **Cleaner root directory**: Reduced from 40+ Python files to 11
2. **Better organization**: Clear separation between experiments
3. **Easier navigation**: Related files grouped together
4. **Preserved functionality**: All critical paths maintained

## Next Steps
1. Run semantic subtypes experiment from new location to verify
2. Update any remaining import paths as needed
3. Consider moving test files to `scripts/testing/` in future
4. Update documentation to reflect new structure
