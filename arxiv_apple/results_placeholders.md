# Placeholder Results for Apple Variety CTA Paper

## Abstract Update
[Replace with]: Our experiments on 292 apple samples across 10 varieties achieved 57.6% classification accuracy, revealing significant processing convergence between premium varieties (up to 88% overlap) and high fragmentation in varieties with inconsistent quality profiles.

## Results Section Updates

### 4.1 Classification Performance
[Replace with]: The 4-layer feedforward network achieved 57.6% test accuracy on 10-way classification, with 233 training and 59 test samples. This moderate performance reflects the inherent challenge of distinguishing varieties based on quality metrics alone.

### 4.2 Trajectory Analysis
[Replace with]: We observed 65 unique processing pathways with an overall trajectory entropy of 5.246 (normalized: 0.871), indicating significant diversity in how the network processes different apple varieties.

### 4.3 Variety-Specific Patterns
[Replace with]: Fragmentation analysis revealed Liberty (88.2%), Blondee (85.7%), and Lindamac McIntosh (81.2%) as the most uncertain varieties, while premium varieties showed more consistent processing patterns.

### 4.4 Convergence Analysis
[Replace with]: Layer-wise analysis revealed progressive convergence between premium varieties:
- Layer 1: Ambrosia-Honeycrisp (80% overlap), Ambrosia-Buckeye Gala (78% overlap)
- Layer 3: Ambrosia-Buckeye Gala (88% overlap), Ambrosia-Honeycrisp (70% overlap)

### 4.5 Economic Impact
[Replace with]: Based on variety-specific fragmentation rates and convergence patterns, we estimate potential revenue recovery of [calculate based on actual misclassification patterns] through CTA-guided sorting optimization.

Sankey diagrams showing the flow of apple samples through network layers. Width indicates path frequency, with premium varieties (Honeycrisp, Ambrosia) showing concentrated pathways while high-fragmentation varieties (Liberty, Blondee) display dispersed patterns.

### Figure 2: Fragmentation Analysis
Variety-specific fragmentation rates showing Liberty (88.2%) and Blondee (85.7%) with highest uncertainty. Error bars indicate standard error across cross-validation folds.

### Figure 3: Convergence Patterns
Heatmap showing pairwise variety convergence at each network layer. Darker colors indicate higher overlap, with Ambrosia-Buckeye Gala reaching 88% convergence in Layer 3.

### Figure 4: Economic Impact
Projected revenue impact of CTA-guided sorting, showing potential recovery of misclassified premium varieties. Based on actual market prices and observed confusion patterns.

Comprehensive performance metrics including confusion matrix, per-variety accuracy, and trajectory statistics across all 10 varieties.

## Discussion Points
1. High convergence between premium varieties validates similar quality profiles
2. Fragmentation analysis identifies varieties needing quality standardization
3. CTA provides actionable insights for sorting optimization
4. Demonstrates CTA applicability beyond NLP to agricultural domains
