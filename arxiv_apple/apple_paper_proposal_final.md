## Abstract

We apply Concept Trajectory Analysis (CTA) to understand how neural networks make routing decisions in apple sorting systems, with implications for preventing economically costly misclassification of premium varieties. Using a dataset of 1,071 apple samples across 350 varieties with chemical, physical, and quality measurements, we investigate whether neural networks develop systematic biases that could lead to misrouting high-value cultivars. We track apple representations through a 4-layer neural network designed for routing decisions (fresh premium/fresh standard/juice processing) and analyze the trajectories using CTA's mathematical framework. Our analysis focuses on: (1) identifying dominant processing pathways and their characteristics, (2) examining where premium varieties like Honeycrisp diverge from or converge with commodity varieties, (3) quantifying trajectory fragmentation as an uncertainty indicator, and (4) proposing targeted interventions based on discovered patterns. This work demonstrates CTA's potential for making agricultural AI systems more interpretable and economically aligned with industry needs.

## 1. Introduction

The apple industry faces a critical challenge in automated sorting: while neural networks achieve high overall accuracy (90-95%) in quality grading and defect detection, they may systematically misroute premium varieties, causing significant economic losses. A Honeycrisp apple commands $2.00-3.50/lb in premium retail channels versus $0.40-0.80/lb if misrouted to commodity processing. Understanding how neural networks make these routing decisions is essential for both economic optimization and building trust in AI-powered agricultural systems.

### Research Questions

This study applies Concept Trajectory Analysis to address:

1. **How do neural networks organize apple varieties** in their internal representations?
2. **What pathways do premium varieties follow** through the network layers?
3. **Where and why might misrouting occur** for high-value cultivars?
4. **Can trajectory-based metrics predict routing uncertainty** and prevent errors?
5. **What targeted interventions** could improve premium variety routing without sacrificing overall accuracy?

### Approach

We use CTA to track how apple samples move through clustered activation spaces across network layers. Unlike static interpretation methods, CTA reveals the dynamic transformation of apple representations from raw measurements to routing decisions. By analyzing these trajectories, we aim to uncover organizational principles that may not align with economic value.

## 2. Background and Motivation

### 2.1 The Apple Sorting Challenge

Modern packing facilities process 50,000-100,000 apples per hour using automated systems that must instantly decide:
- Quality grade (Extra Fancy, Fancy, Commercial)
- Size category (count per box)
- Color requirements
- Defect detection
- Optimal market channel (export, domestic retail, food service, processing)

The economics are highly skewed: premium varieties represent 15-20% of volume but 40-50% of revenue. Misrouting even a small percentage of premium fruit can cost millions annually.

### 2.2 Premium Variety Revolution

The apple industry has transformed with proprietary managed varieties:
- **Honeycrisp** (1991): Known for explosive crispness, commands premium prices
- **Cosmic Crisp** (2019): $100M development investment, tightly controlled production
- **SweeTango**, **Jazz**, **Envy**: Each with unique characteristics and market positioning

These varieties often have chemical profiles that overlap with commodity apples at certain ripeness stages, potentially confusing AI systems trained primarily on chemical metrics.

### 2.3 Why CTA?

Traditional ML interpretability methods (LIME, SHAP, attention visualization) explain individual predictions but miss systemic patterns. CTA offers:
- **Dynamic analysis**: How representations evolve through layers
- **Pattern discovery**: Common pathways and convergence points
- **Uncertainty quantification**: Trajectory fragmentation as confidence indicator
- **Actionable insights**: Where to intervene in the network

## 3. Dataset and Methods

### 3.1 Apple Variety Testing Dataset

We analyze 1,071 samples with complete measurements from 350 apple varieties:

**Variety Distribution:**
- Premium varieties (Honeycrisp, Ambrosia, etc.): 107 samples (10.0%)
- Standard varieties (Gala, McIntosh, Fuji, etc.): 613 samples (57.3%)
- Heirloom/specialty: 351 samples (32.8%)

**Key Features:**
- **Chemical**: Brix (sugar content), acidity (pH), firmness (pressure test)
- **Physical**: Size, weight, color coverage percentage
- **Maturity**: Starch index, harvest timing
- **Quality**: Overall rating, eating quality assessment

### 3.2 Routing Labels

We create routing categories based on industry practice:
1. **Fresh Premium**: Excellent quality + good storage potential
2. **Fresh Standard**: Good quality, standard varieties
3. **Juice/Processing**: Lower quality or poor storage characteristics

Note: 69.7% of samples lack complete quality assessments and are excluded from training.

### 3.3 Neural Network Architecture

We implement a 4-layer feedforward network similar to the heart disease case study in the original CTA paper, appropriate for our feature dimensionality and sample size:

```python
class AppleSortingNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.layers = nn.Sequential(
            # Layer 0: Initial feature processing (8 inputs)
            nn.Linear(8, 32),
            nn.BatchNorm1d(32),
            nn.ReLU(),
            
            # Layer 1: Feature combination and pattern recognition
            nn.Linear(32, 64),
            nn.BatchNorm1d(64),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Dropout(0.2),
            
            # Layer 2: Quality consolidation
            nn.Linear(64, 32),
            nn.BatchNorm1d(32),
            nn.ReLU(),
            
            # Layer 3: Routing decision (3 classes)
            nn.Linear(32, 3)
        )
```

This architecture balances expressiveness with interpretability, allowing CTA to track meaningful transitions while preventing overfitting on our 1,071 samples.

### 3.4 CTA Implementation

- **Clustering**: k-means with Gap statistic for optimal k per layer
- **Trajectory Tracking**: Unique IDs (e.g., L1_C2) across layers
- **Metrics**: 
  - Trajectory Fragmentation (F): Diversity of paths within variety
  - Path-Centroid Fragmentation (F_C): Coherence of individual trajectories
  - Convergence Analysis: Where varieties merge/diverge
- **Analysis Windows**: Given only 4 layers, we analyze transitions between each layer pair

## 4. Analysis Plan

### 4.1 Trajectory Discovery
1. Extract activation trajectories for all samples
2. Identify dominant pathways
3. Characterize each pathway by:
   - Entry conditions (chemical/physical features)
   - Variety composition

### 4.2 Premium Variety Analysis
1. Track Honeycrisp trajectories specifically (84 samples)
2. Compare with commodity varieties (Gala, Fuji)
3. Identify convergence points
4. Quantify separation at each layer

## 6. Preliminary Observations

Initial data exploration reveals interesting patterns:
- **Chemical overlap**: Some Honeycrisp samples have Brix values (14-16Â°) similar to standard Gala
- **Variety imbalance**: Heavy representation of Honeycrisp (84 samples) vs. other premiums
- **Quality subjectivity**: Text-based quality ratings require careful encoding
- **Missing data**: Many samples lack complete feature sets

These observations suggest that chemical features alone may be insufficient for variety routing, validating the need for trajectory analysis.
