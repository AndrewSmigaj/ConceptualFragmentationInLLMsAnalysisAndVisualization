# Network Architecture Considerations for Apple Sorting

## Why 12 layers is too deep:

1. **Input complexity**: We only have ~8-10 features (Brix, firmness, acidity, size, color, etc.)
2. **Task complexity**: 3-class classification (premium/standard/juice)
3. **Sample size**: Only 1,071 samples - deep networks would overfit
4. **Industry standards**: Commercial sorting systems typically use shallow networks for speed

## More appropriate architecture:

### Option 1: 4-layer network (following heart disease example in CTA paper)
```python
class AppleSortingNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.layers = nn.Sequential(
            # L0: Input processing
            nn.Linear(8, 32),
            nn.BatchNorm1d(32),
            nn.ReLU(),
            
            # L1: Feature combination
            nn.Linear(32, 64),
            nn.BatchNorm1d(64),
            nn.ReLU(),
            
            # L2: Quality assessment
            nn.Linear(64, 32),
            nn.BatchNorm1d(32),
            nn.ReLU(),
            
            # L3: Routing decision
            nn.Linear(32, 3)  # 3 routing classes
        )
```

### Option 2: 6-layer network (middle ground)
- Allows more complex feature interactions
- Still tractable for CTA analysis
- Better for capturing chemical-variety relationships

### Benefits of shallower network:
1. **Interpretability**: Easier to track trajectories
2. **Training**: Faster, less prone to overfitting
3. **Deployment**: Real-time processing feasible
4. **CTA clarity**: Clearer phase transitions

The heart disease case study used only 3 hidden layers and found meaningful pathways!
