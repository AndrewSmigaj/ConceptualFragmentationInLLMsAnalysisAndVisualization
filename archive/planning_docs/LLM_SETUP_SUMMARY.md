# LLM Setup and Testing Summary

## What We've Accomplished

1. **Created modified dataset file with centroids**:
   - Added synthetic centroids to the existing Titanic cluster paths file
   - Saved as `data/cluster_paths/titanic_seed_0_paths_with_centroids.json`

2. **Generated mock LLM analysis results**:
   - Created mock cluster labels and path narratives for testing
   - Saved to two locations for reliable discovery:
     - `data/llm/titanic_seed_0_mock.json`
     - `results/llm/titanic_seed_0_mock.json`

3. **Enhanced dashboard integration**:
   - Modified the LLM tab to automatically find and load existing results
   - Enabled testing of LLM features without API keys

4. **Added documentation**:
   - Updated the existing LLM README with testing instructions
   - Created a dedicated README_LLM_TESTING.md file for newcomers

## How to Test

1. Start the dashboard: `python visualization/main.py`
2. Select the "Titanic" dataset with seed 0
3. Go to the "LLM Integration" tab
4. The dashboard should automatically load the mock results
5. Explore the cluster labels and path narratives

## Next Steps

To use real LLM APIs instead of mock data:

1. Set up API keys in `concept_fragmentation/llm/api_keys.py`
2. Install required dependencies: `pip install aiohttp requests numpy`
3. Generate proper cluster paths data with `concept_fragmentation/analysis/cluster_paths.py`
4. Run the dashboard and generate analysis with your preferred LLM provider

## Mock Data Structure

The mock data follows the same format that would be generated by real LLM APIs:

```json
{
  "dataset": "titanic",
  "seed": 0,
  "provider": "mock",
  "model": "mock-model",
  "cluster_labels": {
    "layer1C0": "High Survival likelihood",
    "layer1C1": "Low Luxury traveler",
    ...
  },
  "path_narratives": {
    "0": "This path represents a journey through 4 layers...",
    ...
  }
}
```

This structure is compatible with the dashboard's LLM tab, allowing you to test the visualization and user interface features without needing actual LLM API access.
