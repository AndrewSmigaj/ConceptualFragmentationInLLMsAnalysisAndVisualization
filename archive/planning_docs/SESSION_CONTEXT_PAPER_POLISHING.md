# Session Context: Paper Polishing for Concept Trajectory Analysis

## Current Status
We are polishing the arxiv paper for submission. The GPT-2 semantic subtypes section is complete with groundbreaking findings about grammatical vs semantic organization.

## Key Findings to Preserve
1. **GPT-2 organizes by grammar, not semantics**: 72.8% of words converge to "noun superhighway"
2. **Convergence pattern**: 19 paths → 5 paths → 4 paths (Early/Middle/Late windows)
3. **Phase transition**: Stability drops from 0.724 to 0.339 marking semantic→grammatical shift
4. **Heart disease case study**: Shows CTA's power for traditional ML interpretability

## Recent Changes Made
1. ✅ Updated Abstract - removed 8-day timeline, emphasized grammar discovery
2. ✅ Updated Future Directions - added vision for pathway logging in LLMs
3. ✅ Updated Introduction - added compelling hook about cat/computer/democracy
4. ✅ Updated Conclusion - removed 8-day timeline, kept heart disease + Titanic

## Todo List Status
- [x] Update GPT-2 semantic subtypes section
- [x] Create paper polishing plan
- [x] Review and update abstract
- [x] Polish introduction section
- [ ] Update mathematical foundations if needed
- [ ] Polish experimental design section
- [x] Update future directions section
- [x] Polish conclusion
- [ ] Review all figures and tables
- [ ] Final proofreading pass

## Next Tasks
1. **Generate Heart Disease Sankey diagrams** if not already created
2. **Focus on Heart Disease case study** (remove Titanic if needed)
3. Continue polishing remaining sections

## Important Notes
- We decided NOT to mention 8-day development timeline in paper (unprofessional)
- Heart disease dataset shows proof of concept better than Titanic
- Need Sankey diagrams for heart disease visualization

## Git Status at Start
- Modified: experiments/gpt2/pivot/gpt2_pivot_clusterer.py
- Modified: experiments/gpt2/semantic_subtypes/gpt2_semantic_subtypes_experiment.py
- Multiple new files in experiments/gpt2/semantic_subtypes/

## Paper Structure
Located in: `/arxiv_submission/`
- main.tex
- sections/
  - abstract.tex (updated)
  - introduction.tex (updated)
  - conclusion.tex (updated)
  - future_directions.tex (updated)
  - gpt2_semantic_subtypes_case_study.tex (complete)
  - [other sections need review]

## Key Metrics to Preserve
- Cluster counts: Layer 0 has k=4, Layers 1-11 have k=2
- Convergence: 72.8% to noun superhighway
- Stability: 0.724 → 0.339 → 0.341
- Path reduction: 19 → 5 → 4

## Visualization Assets
- Concept MRI Dashboard: `/experiments/gpt2/semantic_subtypes/unified_cta/concept_mri_dashboard_bootstrap.html`
- Sankey diagrams: in `results/unified_cta_config/unified_cta_20250524_073316/`

## Resume Instructions
When resuming:
1. Check if heart disease Sankey diagrams exist
2. If not, generate them using similar approach to GPT-2 semantic subtypes
3. Continue with paper sections that need polishing
4. Ensure heart disease is prominently featured as proof of concept
