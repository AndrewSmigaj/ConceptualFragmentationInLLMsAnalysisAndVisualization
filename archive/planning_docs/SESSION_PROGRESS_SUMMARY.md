# Session Progress Summary - Paper Polishing and Visualizations

## Date: January 25, 2025

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Paper Content Cleanup
- **Removed redundant sections**: Merged background into introduction, use_cases into future directions, societal_impact into conclusion
- **Fixed duplicate content**: Removed repeated metric definitions and misplaced figures
- **Reorganized GPT-2 content**: Removed wrong case study, moved ETS discussion to future directions
- **Terminology update**: Changed "noun superhighway" to "entity superhighway" throughout

### 2. Sankey Diagram Improvements

#### Heart Disease Sankey
- Fixed overlapping nodes issue through iterative refinement:
  - Adjusted node positions with alternating pattern
  - Increased padding from 25 to 40 pixels
  - Reduced node thickness to 10 pixels
  - Added `arrangement='fixed'` to prevent automatic repositioning
  - Increased figure height to 800px with larger margins
  - Final version: `heart_sankey_final_no_cutoff.png`

#### GPT-2 Sankey Diagrams
- Created improved versions for all three windows (early, middle, late)
- Better layout with consistent colors and phase labels
- Updated terminology to "entity superhighway"
- Files: `gpt2_sankey_early_improved.png`, `gpt2_sankey_middle_improved.png`, `gpt2_sankey_late_improved.png`

### 3. Trajectory Visualizations

#### Heart Disease Trajectories
- Created UMAP-based 3D stepped-layer visualization
- Iterative refinement process:
  1. Started with synthetic data (caught and fixed!)
  2. Attempted centroid-based archetypal paths (appeared in center)
  3. Switched to representative patient trajectories
  4. Found balanced approach with:
     - 150 individual trajectories (blue=no disease, red=disease)
     - 5 archetypal paths as thicker lines with moderate colors
     - Opacity: 0.3 for individuals, 0.8 for archetypes
     - Width: 1.5px for individuals, 6px for archetypes
- Final version: `heart_trajectories_balanced_final.png`

#### GPT-2 Trajectories
- Created three window-based visualizations (early, middle, late)
- Used actual windowed analysis data where available
- UMAP reduction with cosine similarity for text embeddings
- Files: `gpt2_stepped_layer_early.png`, `gpt2_stepped_layer_middle.png`, `gpt2_stepped_layer_late.png`

### 4. Key Technical Insights

#### UMAP Centroids Issue
- Discovered that UMAP-reducing centroids places them in the center of the space
- Solution: Use representative patients (closest to centroid) instead of synthetic averages

#### Visualization Balance
- Learned importance of balanced visual design:
  - Not too bright/dark
  - Not too thick/thin
  - Not too opaque/transparent
  - Finding the middle ground for clarity

### 5. Paper Integration
- Added trajectory visualization to heart disease case study
- Created new subsection "Visualizations: Patient Flow and Trajectories"
- Comprehensive figure captions explaining the visualizations

## Key Lessons Learned

1. **Always use real data** - Never synthesize data for scientific visualizations
2. **Balance is key** - Avoid extreme visual choices
3. **Test incrementally** - Small changes are easier to debug than complete rewrites
4. **UMAP behavior** - Centroids without neighborhood structure get placed centrally
5. **Fixed positioning** - Use `arrangement='fixed'` for Plotly Sankey diagrams to prevent automatic adjustments

## Next Steps Mentioned
- Moving to a new GitHub project for something fun!

Great work today on polishing the paper and creating compelling visualizations!
