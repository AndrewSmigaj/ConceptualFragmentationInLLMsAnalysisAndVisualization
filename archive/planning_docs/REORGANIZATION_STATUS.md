# Repository Reorganization Status

**Date**: 2025-05-30

## Completed Actions

### 1. Test File Consolidation ✅
- Created `tests/legacy/` directory
- Moved 3 HTML test files from root to `tests/legacy/`
- Root directory is now cleaner

### 2. New Directory Structure ✅
Created the following directories for better organization:
- `data/` - Centralized data management
  - `raw/` - Original datasets
  - `processed/` - Preprocessed data
  - `activations/` - Neural network activations
- `results/` - Structured experiment results
  - `gpt2/{semantic_subtypes,bigrams}`
  - `heart_disease/`
  - `titanic/`
- `configs/` - Centralized configuration
  - `experiments/`
  - `models/`
  - `visualization/`
- `tests/` - Consolidated test directory
  - `unit/`
  - `integration/`
  - `legacy/`

### 3. Documentation Updates ✅
- Updated `concept_fragmentation/README.md` to focus on CTA
- Created `data/README.md` with data management guidelines
- Created `results/README.md` with result organization conventions
- Created `configs/README.md` with configuration examples
- Updated `ARCHITECTURE.md` to reflect new structure

### 4. Design Decisions ✅
- Kept `venv311/` at root (Python best practice)
- Preserved core library structure in `concept_fragmentation/`
- Maintained separation between library and experiments
- Designed structure to support future bigram experiments

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Phase 4 continuation)
1. Update `.gitignore` for new directories
2. Consider moving large activation chunks to `data/activations/`
3. Create example configuration files

### Future Phases
- Phase 5: Consolidate GPT-2 analysis scripts
- Phase 6: Unify dashboard components  
- Phase 7: Clean up experiments/gpt2/all_tokens/
- Phase 8: Implement bigram experiment framework (when ready)

## Benefits Realized

1. **Cleaner root directory** - No test files cluttering the top level
2. **Better data management** - Clear separation of data, code, and results
3. **Configuration ready** - Structure for YAML-based experiment configs
4. **Future-proof** - Ready for bigram and other experiments
5. **Standard layout** - Follows Python project best practices

## Important Notes

- The 1.8GB activation chunks remain in `experiments/gpt2/all_tokens/activations/`
- Consider moving them to `data/activations/` in a future phase
- All existing functionality preserved
- No breaking changes to imports or paths
