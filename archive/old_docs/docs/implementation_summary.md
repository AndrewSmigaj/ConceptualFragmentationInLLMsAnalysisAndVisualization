# Neural Network Concept Fragmentation Visualization - Implementation Summary

## Completed Implementation

We have successfully implemented a comprehensive visualization system for analyzing concept fragmentation in neural networks. The implementation follows the plan outlined in `visualization_plan.md` and includes the following components:

### Core Components
1. **Data Interface (`data_interface.py`)**
   - Functions for loading statistics from CSV files
   - Methods for accessing layer activations from PKL files
   - Configuration helpers for baseline and regularized models
   - Dataset metadata management

2. **Dimension Reduction (`reducers.py`)**
   - UMAP wrapper with consistent parameters
   - Disk caching to avoid recomputation
   - Support for embedding layer activations across multiple seeds

3. **Trajectory Plotting (`traj_plot.py`)**
   - Multi-panel 3D visualizations with Plotly
   - Sample trajectory lines connecting layers
   - Direction arrows and highlighting for important samples
   - Normalization and camera synchronization across views

4. **Dash Web App (`dash_app.py`)**
   - Interactive dashboard for exploring visualizations
   - Controls for filtering, highlighting, and visualization settings
   - Export capabilities for sharing and publication

5. **Command-line Interface (`main.py`)**
   - Batch processing of multiple datasets
   - Configurable visualization parameters
   - Output in multiple formats (HTML, PDF)

6. **Testing & Examples**
   - Jupyter notebook for sanity checking (`notebooks/sanity_checks.ipynb`)
   - Example code for using the API

### Key Features

- **3D Embeddings** show how samples traverse the network
- **Multi-panel Visualization** allows comparison across layers
- **Baseline vs. Regularized Comparison** highlights the impact of cohesion regularization
- **Interactive Exploration** with rotation, filtering, and highlighting
- **Disk Caching** for efficient reuse of UMAP embeddings

## Next Steps

To fully deploy and utilize this visualization system:

1. **Dependency Installation**
   - Install required packages: `pip install -r visualization/requirements.txt`
   - Ensure access to the data directory or update paths in `config.py`

2. **Initial Testing**
   - Run the sanity check notebook to validate the implementation
   - Try a small-scale visualization with `python visualization/main.py titanic --seeds 0`

3. **Data Collection Enhancement**
   - Implement more sophisticated sample selection for highlighting
   - Add functionality to extract actual class data for coloring points

4. **Full Visualization Suite**
   - Generate visualizations for all datasets and configurations
   - Create a set of publication-quality figures for the paper

5. **Documentation & Sharing**
   - Complete code documentation and example usage
   - Prepare interactive HTML files for sharing with collaborators

## Usage Examples

Run from command line:
```bash
# Generate visualizations for both datasets
python visualization/main.py titanic heart --output-dir results/visualizations

# Launch interactive dashboard
python visualization/dash_app.py
```

## Known Limitations

1. The current implementation uses random samples for highlighting instead of actual high-fragmentation samples.
2. Class coloring requires additional data extraction to be fully implemented.
3. Terminal testing has been challenging due to output truncation issues.

## Conclusion

The implemented visualization system provides a powerful tool for understanding concept fragmentation in neural networks. It allows researchers to visualize how cohesion regularization affects the trajectory of samples through the network, potentially providing insights into why regularization improves performance and generalization.
