# Configuration System Implementation

## Overview

We've implemented a new hierarchical, class-based configuration system that enhances the project's configurability while maintaining full backward compatibility with the legacy system. The new system provides the following benefits:

- **Type safety** using Python dataclasses
- **Validation** of configuration values
- **Hierarchical organization** of related settings
- **Serialization/deserialization** to/from JSON and YAML
- **Environment-specific configurations**
- **Per-experiment configurations**
- **Command-line interface** for configuration management

## Components

The implementation consists of the following core components:

### 1. Configuration Classes

A set of dataclasses that represent different aspects of configuration:

- `Config`: Root configuration class that contains all other configuration components
- `DatasetConfig`: Dataset-specific configuration (path, features, etc.)
- `ModelConfig`: Model architecture configuration (hidden dimensions, activation, etc.)
- `TrainingConfig`: Training hyperparameters (batch size, learning rate, etc.)
- `RegularizationConfig`: Regularization settings (weight, temperature, etc.)
- `MetricsConfig`: Metrics computation settings with nested metric-specific configurations
- `VisualizationConfig`: Visualization settings with nested plot-specific configurations
- `AnalysisConfig`: Analysis settings for archetypal path analysis

Each class includes:
- Type annotations for all fields
- Default values for optional fields
- Validation in `__post_init__` methods
- Serialization/deserialization methods

### 2. Configuration Manager

A singleton class (`ConfigManager`) that provides:

- Access to the current configuration
- Loading from files (JSON, YAML)
- Loading from dictionaries
- Override for specific values
- Validation of the configuration
- Experiment-specific configurations
- Backward compatibility with the legacy configuration

### 3. Default Configurations

A module that provides default configurations for all components:

- Default configurations for common datasets (Titanic, Adult, Heart, Fashion MNIST)
- Default model architectures
- Default training parameters
- Default regularization settings
- Default metrics and visualization settings

### 4. Module-Level Compatibility Layer

A compatibility layer in `config/__init__.py` that:

- Exports the legacy configuration constants (`RANDOM_SEED`, `MODELS`, etc.)
- Maintains the same import pattern for backward compatibility
- Creates the legacy configuration structure from the new one

### 5. Command-Line Interface

A command-line interface for managing configurations:

- Viewing current configuration
- Exporting to JSON or YAML
- Importing from JSON or YAML
- Validating configuration files

## Integration with Existing Code

The new configuration system is fully integrated with existing code through the compatibility layer. All existing imports continue to work without modification, while new code can use the enhanced features of the new system.

## Testing

The implementation includes comprehensive tests:

- Unit tests for configuration classes
- Unit tests for the `ConfigManager` class
- Integration tests with the training module
- Validation tests to ensure compatibility

## Migration Path

We've provided a migration guide (`docs/config_migration_guide.md`) for developers to transition from the legacy configuration to the new system at their own pace. The guide includes:

- Example code showing both legacy and new approaches
- Best practices for using the new system
- Command-line interface documentation
- Mapping between legacy imports and their new equivalents

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements to the configuration system:

1. **Environment variable support**: Allow overriding configuration values using environment variables
2. **Configuration schema**: Generate JSON schema for configuration validation
3. **Web UI**: Add a web interface for editing configuration visually
4. **Configuration versioning**: Track and manage configuration versions
5. **Configuration diff**: Compare different configurations easily

## Conclusion

The new configuration system provides a robust foundation for managing configuration across the project while ensuring a smooth transition from the legacy system. It enhances type safety, maintainability, and extensibility while maintaining backward compatibility.
