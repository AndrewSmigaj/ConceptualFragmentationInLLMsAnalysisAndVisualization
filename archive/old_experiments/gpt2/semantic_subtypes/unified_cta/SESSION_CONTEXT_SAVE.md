# Session Context Save - GPT-2 Concept MRI Analysis

## Current State Summary

### What We Accomplished Today

1. **Fixed Missing ETS Component**: Integrated ETS micro-clustering into the unified CTA approach that was missing from the todo list.

2. **Created Comprehensive Experiment Design**: 
   - File: `FINAL_EXPERIMENT_DESIGN.md`
   - Unified approach: Gap statistic + ETS micro-clustering
   - Windowed analysis: Early (L0-L3), Middle (L4-L7), Late (L8-L11)

3. **Discovered Major Issue**: Cluster identity confusion (L4_C1 ≠ L7_C1) - implemented unique labeling scheme

4. **Found Existing Semantic Categories**: Instead of implementing POS tagging, found we already had semantic categories in the curated data

5. **Created LLM Analysis Report**: 
   - File: `gpt2_semantic_analysis_report.md`
   - Key finding: GPT-2 organizes by grammar, not semantics
   - 72.8% convergence to dominant noun pathway

6. **Built Complete Concept MRI Visualization**:
   - Created data preparation script (`prepare_mri_data.py`)
   - Generated enhanced Sankey diagrams (`generate_mri_sankeys.py`)
   - Created path analysis tables (`generate_path_tables.py`)
   - Built Bootstrap dashboard (`concept_mri_dashboard_bootstrap.html`)

### Key Findings

1. **Cluster Counts** (IMPORTANT - we verified this):
   - Layer 0: 4 clusters (k=4)
   - Layers 1-11: 2 clusters each (k=2)
   - NO L11_C2 exists (that was an error)

2. **Path Evolution**:
   - Early window: 19 paths
   - Middle window: 5 paths  
   - Late window: 4 paths
   - 72.8% convergence to noun superhighway

3. **Grammatical Organization**:
   - GPT-2 rapidly shifts from semantic (animals vs objects) to grammatical (nouns vs modifiers)
   - Complete adjective-adverb merger
   - No separate verb cluster

### Dashboard Features

1. **Bootstrap-based responsive design**
2. **Three Sankey diagrams side-by-side** (Early, Middle, Late windows)
3. **Archetypal paths below each Sankey** with:
   - Full cluster labels (e.g., "L0_C1 (Tangible Objects)")
   - Frequencies and percentages
   - Semantic composition
   - LLM insights
4. **Bottom panel with tabs**:
   - Summary of cluster evolution
   - All cluster labels
   - Key insights

### Important Technical Details

1. **Cluster Labels** (LLM-generated interpretations):
   ```javascript
   // Layer 0 (4 clusters)
   L0_C0: "Animate Creatures"
   L0_C1: "Tangible Objects"
   L0_C2: "Scalar Properties"  
   L0_C3: "Abstract & Relational"
   
   // Layers 1-11 (2 clusters each)
   C0: "Modifier/Property Space"
   C1: "Entity/Object Space"
   ```

2. **Path Compositions**: Not pure categories but mixtures:
   - Noun highway: animals + objects + abstracts
   - Modifier highway: adjectives + adverbs mixed
   - Small mixed path: contains verbs but routes to entity cluster

3. **Visualization Principles**:
   - No scrollbars except main page
   - Sankey diagrams at 200px height
   - All archetypal paths visible
   - Cluster labels integrated everywhere

### Todo Items Status

From the todo list, we completed:
- [x] Create data preparation script
- [x] Generate Sankey diagrams  
- [x] Create path analysis tables
- [x] Create main dashboard
- [x] Add cluster labels everywhere

Still pending:
- [ ] Implement actual word search functionality
- [ ] Run ETS micro-clustering analysis
- [ ] Calculate cross-layer metrics (ρᶜ, J, F)

### Key Insight for Paper

The "Concept MRI" reveals GPT-2's brain organizes language like a postal system: early layers sort by appearance (semantic), middle layers reorganize by function (grammatical), and late layers maintain stable superhighways for parts of speech. A "cat" and "computer" travel the same path not because they're similar, but because they're both nouns.

### Next Steps When You Return

1. The dashboard is complete and functional
2. All visualizations show correct cluster counts (4 for L0, 2 for L1-11)
3. The LinkedIn article is ready to post
4. Consider running the ETS micro-clustering to find sub-patterns within the dominant paths
5. The experiment is ready for the paper's case study section

### Critical Reminders

- The experiment uses data from: `unified_cta_20250524_073316`
- All paths use unique cluster labels (L{layer}_C{cluster})
- The 72.8% convergence is to the noun pathway, not a percentage of nouns
- Layer 0 has 4 clusters, all other layers have 2 clusters
- There is no separate verb cluster - verbs route through existing clusters
